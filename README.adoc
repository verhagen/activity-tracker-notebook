== The Idea

This project is about tracking activities and time. In a simple and easy way. So one can use them later to see when was time spent
on a certain activity and how much time was spent, that day / week / month, on that activity.

**Fundamental Ideas:**

- Easy to use
- Log entries should be easy to create, read and understand


== Background

⌚ **Time Consuming**
Many times one needs to records certain activities. Like working on a particular project and / or task. Many time tracking
systems are quit time consuming in registering starting / stopping a task or entering the duration. Because it's so time
intensive and not quick (user friendly), many people don't like to do it. Or when required only do it once a day / week /
month.

🖥️ **Multiple Systems**
It would not be the first time that entering the same activity data is required in to multiple systems. And that these
systems don't support an easy way of exporting and importing of the time spent on activities.

👔 **Multiple Clients / Broker**
Maybe one works for multiple clients, and need to know in some  point at end of the week or month, how many time was spent
for a certain client. To create and sent the invoice, but maybe also for entering these hours spent, in a client specific
time registration system.

Or maybe you work through a broker, which probably also requires those hours spent at a client on a specific project. So
again entering the same data in to a system.

💼 **Book Keeping**
Maybe you're required to record all hours worked in a year. And doing administrative tasks or exploring
potential new opportunities might count as working hours, although you can't sent a invoice for it.

🔍 **Historical Search**
When keeping an easy to read activity logbook, it should be easy to find back historical information.


== General Ideas

- Create (per day) multiple entries in the Activity Tracker Log.
- Generate an Activity Logbook, from which information is extracted, like:
**  time spent on certain activity / activities
**  time spent for certain client
**  time spent on self study
**  time spent reading certain book
**  time spent reading books, this month
**  time spent on a specific activity this day / week / month / year / overall
**  where has time been spent on a certain day / week / month / year

- Quick and easy way to start / stop working on activities +
  Each _Activity Tracker Event_ contains:
**  TimeStamp
**  Identifier (BreadCrumbPath)
**  Command
**  Note (optional)

**  Author (configurable)
**  Location (configurable)
