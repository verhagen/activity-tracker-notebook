When the xref:applications.adoc=_monolithic_application[_Monolithic Application_] or
xref:applications.adoc=_microservices_api[_Microservices API_] starts it will load the configuration.



Read the `IdentifierCatalog` from disk, if there is a cache available.

NOTE: Maybe some structures, like those of the `issues` should be scanned, for the current active ones.
Those moved to the `_attic` should no longer be concerned relevant for active identifiers.


== ðŸª‚ Landing

Write the current `IdentifierCatalog` to disk, under cache.
