= Mind Map - Notebook Structure

The structure of a _notebook_ could look like:

[source]
----
notebook/.atnb/                    // Configuration
        /_atnb/contacts.hjson      // Reference Data
              /meetings.hjson
              /projects.hjson
              /teams.hjson
        /manuals                   // Documentation (in MarkDown, AsciiDoc, etc)
        /notes/architecture        // Documentation (in MarkDown, AsciiDoc, etc)
              /ideas               // Documentation (in MarkDown, AsciiDoc, etc)
              /pocs
              /mind-maps
              /roadmaps
              /...
        /issues/_attic/<issue-id>  // Small notes about each issues you work on. Like a whiteboard, small tips. Contacts. 
               /<issue-id>         // Small notes about each issues you work on. Like a whiteboard, small tips. Contacts. 
                                   // All kind of small things, which you don't want to put in the real issue. But which
                                   // are handy as reference.
        /time-sheets               // Put here your downloaded time-sheet files, so they get backed up as well.
        /activity-tracker/activity-commands.log  // All atnb command log entries
        /generated                  // The Activity Tracker generated content
        /generated/logbooks/2021.03-logbook.adoc    // The Activity Tracker Logbooks will be generated from the Activity Tracker Events

*Remarks*:
- If there are too many issues at some point, just move them to the __attic_

- Maybe sometimes working on multiple project, with their own issues. Maybe one likes to place those in their own map.

notebook/projects/<project-a>/issues/A-10.adoc
                 /<project-b>/issues/B-1122.adoc

*Questions*:
- Where to put cache files?
+
In the `.cache` directory inside an `organisation` or `notebook` (space), and then within the `.atnb` directory.


The structure for a location with multiple _notebooks_ could look like:

[source]
----
notebooks/<organisation>/
         /my/<cookbook>/recipes/boeuf-bourguignon.adoc                 // Identifier: cookbook.recipes.boeuf-bourguignon
         /my/<cookbook>/recipes/main-courses/boeuf-bourguignon.adoc    // Identifier: cookbook.recipes.category.main-courses.boeuf-bourguignon  (adds a category)
         /my/<hobby>/.atnb/links.hjson
                    /notes/ideas/
                          /images
                    /materials
                    /stock
                 
----


Contents of the `.atnb` directory, which can be part of a organisation or space.
[source]
----
.atnb/content-and-structure  # Templates for creating content and structure
     /links.?
     /tags.yaml
     /.cache
----

There will also be a user specific `.atnb` directory
[source]
----
~/.atnb/.cache
       /.cache/organisations.yaml  # Contains urls of organisation
       /scan-locations.yaml        # Contains urls of loccations to scan for new content
