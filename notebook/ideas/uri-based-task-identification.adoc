= Idea - URI based Task Identification

Currently it is poossible to add an article in the following way:

----
article  add  https://www.baeldung.com/eclipse-debugging[Debugging with Eclipse]
----

It would be very nice, to just write:

----
https://www.baeldung.com/eclipse-debugging[Debugging with Eclipse]
https://www.baeldung.com/eclipse-debugging
----

* Just based on the URI host `baeldung.com`, it should be categorized as an `article`, so the `ArticleTask` is used.
* This task should use the uri, to extract the title. 
* Check the title for known tag names, in this case `eclipse` should be added as tag.
