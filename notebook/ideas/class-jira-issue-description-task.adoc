_Writing in AsciiDoc is easier than writing in Jira Wiki Format_

For those who prefer to write in AsciiDoc format, and then convert it into Jira Wiki format.

== Action List

- create a new document (file) based on a new Jira issue ID (maybe first a temporal name, with a timestamp instead of a number)
- write the document
- convert it to Jira wiki syntax
- copy / past the generated content to Jira
- create an yaml with the issue fields
- use Jira api, to post create a new issue and post the content
- clone the issue from Jira to local file (in prefered format) +
  keep a copy of the original, to see if anything has changed, before a push
